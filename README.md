# ItemRack-TBC-Anniversary-Fix read about me, do the zip file, replace existing. If that doesn't help, ask chatgpt, that's what i used to do this! https://github.com/SmokefuryTv/ItemRack-TBC-Anniversary-Fix
Live now, Kick and Twitch, SmokeFury,  i just spent 5 hours fixing it. <3 After working with ChatGPT, i patched Itemrack and it should should work. I am NOT the original dev, just someone that really enjoys the addon and wanted it working for TBC.
Happy Leveling
