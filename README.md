As of typing this i just spent 5 hours fixing it. After working with ChatGPT, i patched Itemrack and it should should work. I am NOT the original dev, just someone that really enjoys the addon and wanted it working for TBC.
for now you can swap item sets and make outfits, change items by hovering over them in the character screen, have each item on screen with alt click, and change the items via those alt click onsceen boxes. Clicking doesn't trigger the trinket/item yet, that's what i will work on
Happy Leveling
